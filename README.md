# Project Road Segmentation
Road Segmentation Project done in the Machine Learning class at EPFL in the fall of 2017.

## Dependencies & Installation
- [python](https://www.python.org) version 3.6
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) for array and tensor manipulation.
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) and [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org) for image processing.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plots.
- [keras](https://keras.io) version 2.0.8 for machine learning with the TensorFlow backend.

All dependencies can be installed with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) for python 3.6.
Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-image and matplotlib are already installed in the basic conda package.
To install keras use the command line 'conda install keras'.

## Running our model

We saved our trained model in the file [...TODO...]
Simply run the file run.py which will load the model and predict on the tests images and produce the same submission.csv as the one given on Kaggle.
